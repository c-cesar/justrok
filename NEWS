0.6	UNRELEASED

  NEW FEATURES

    * Repeat mode: repeat track or repeat playlist.

    * Random mode.

    * Handle the return key in the playlist search line, starting to
      play the first item that matched the search.

  BUGFIXES

    * Searching in the tree view handles non-ASCII characters case
      insensitivity. Formerly case insensitiveness only coped with ASCII.

    * When reaching the end of the track marked as "stop after this
      track", playing stops but the current track jumps to the next track.
      Formerly it would stay at the just played track.

    * The Next button is enabled when at the last item in the playlist,
      but there are items left in the queue.

    * The playlist scrolls automatically to ensure the currently playing
      item is always visible. This is particularly handy for random mode.

    * Items don't get added more than once to the playlist even if they're
      present multiple times in the drag object (eg. when doing Ctrl-A).

    * If Minirok is docked in the systray when logging out of KDE, it will
      be there as well when restoring the session. Formerly the main window
      would always be shown.

    * Minirok does not cancel logging out when the main window is visible.
