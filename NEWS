0.6	UNRELEASED

  BUGFIXES

    * Searching in the tree view handles non-ASCII characters case
      insensitivity. Formerly case insensitiveness only coped with ASCII.

    * When reaching the end of the track marked as "stop after this
      track", playing stops but the current track jumps to the next track.
      Formerly it would stay at the just played track.
