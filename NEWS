0.7	IN DEVELOPMENT

  NEW FEATURES

    * Calculate the length of tracks when loading them into the
      playlist, instead of just when starting to play them, unless
      reading of tags is disabled.

    * The systray icon will show the currently playing track as a
      tooltip.

  BUGFIXES

    * When adding tracks to the queue while playing the last track in
      the playlist, the Next button would not get enabled.

    * Then length of tracks is calculated with Mutagen instead of
      GStreamer, which fixes several cases where GStreamer would get the
      length wrong.

    * Ctrl+LeftButtonClick works to select several items in the playlist.

    * Exit the engine thread cleanly, so that there are no unhandled
      exceptions when quitting.

    * The contextual menu can handle enqueueing several tracks at once.


0.6	2007-09-04

  NEW FEATURES

    * Repeat mode: repeat track or repeat playlist.

    * Random mode.

    * Handle the return key in the playlist search line, starting to
      play the first item that matched the search; and in the tree view
      search line, appending matching items to the playlist and starting
      playback if the player was stopped.

    * Minirok accepts files to load into the playlist as arguments.

    * New command line option -a/--append and accompanying DCOP function
      appendToPlaylist to append given files to an existing Minirok
      instance. For --append, if no instance is running, a new one will
      be started.

  BUGFIXES

    * Searching in the tree view handles non-ASCII characters case
      insensitivity. Formerly case insensitiveness only coped with ASCII.

    * "Stop after current" works even if the currently played item is
      not present in the playlist (i.e., has been removed).

    * The Next button is enabled when at the last item in the playlist,
      but with items still left in the queue.

    * Items don't get added more than once to the playlist even if they're
      present multiple times in the drag object (eg. when doing Ctrl-A).

    * Minirok does not cancel logging out when the main window is visible.

  OTHER CHANGES

    * When reaching the end of the track marked as "stop after this
      track", playing stops but the current track jumps to the next track.
      Formerly it would stay at the just played track.

    * The playlist scrolls automatically to ensure the currently playing
      item is always visible. This is particularly handy for random mode.

    * If the list gets cleared while playing a certain track, and then
      that track gets added to the playlist while still being played,
      the playlist will mark it the current track.

    * If Minirok is docked in the systray when logging out of KDE, it will
      be there as well when restoring the session. Formerly the main window
      would always be shown.

    * Empty directories are not shown in the tree view. This includes
      directories that contain no playable files. Directories which only
      contain empty subdirectories are not shown as well, recursively.
