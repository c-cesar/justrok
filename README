Description
===========

Minirok is a small music player written in Python for the K Desktop
Environment. As its name hints, it's modelled after Amarok, but with a
reduced set of features. In particular, it is designed to cover all the
needs and wishes of the author, leaving everything else out.

The main interface is a *tree view of the filesystem*, with a playlist
that can only be populated via drag and drop. There is no collection
built from tags, so it's targetted at people whose collection is
structured in a tree already at the filesystem level. Searches can be
performed both in the tree view and the playlist.

Other features include:

  * DCOP interface for controlling the player and retrieving the
    currently played track

  * alter the playing order in the playlist by queueing tracks;
    stop after a certain track; undo and redo

  * reading of tags when adding to the playlist can be disabled by
    specifying a regex to extract them from the filename

  * submission of played songs to Last.fm (with lastfmsubmitd)

  * support for the classic Amarok "funky-monkey" theme

  * global keybindings (see README.Usage for details)


Audio formats
=============

Minirok supports playing and reading tags from MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC and
Musepack, which are the formats I use. If you need some other format,
please send me a polite e-mail and I will add them if GStreamer and
Mutagen support them (which they'll probably will).


Motivation
==========

I've been a happy Amarok user for more than three years, but after ...
