Submitting played tracks to Last.fm
===================================

Minirok can submit played tracks to Last.fm if the program "lastfmsubmitd"
is installed. If you get stuck configuring it, here's a simple recipe to
have it running in one minute:

    % mkdir -p ~/.lastfm/spool
    % ln -s /usr/bin/lastfmsubmitd ~/.kde/Autostart
    % cat >~/.lastfmsubmitd.conf
[account]
user = you
password = XXX

[paths]
log = /home/you/.lastfm/log
spool = /home/you/.lastfm/spool
