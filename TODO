(This list is obviosly not complete, just here to not forget of these.)

Tree View:
  * Button/context menu to refresh the tree view? (Or be able to monitor
    file tree with inotify instead)
  * Remove artifacts in the pointer when dragging (display file count?)
  * Use a regex as well to control the appearance of file names?

Playlist:
  * Undo/redo?
  * Tabs??
  * If while playing the list gets cleared, and then the currently
    playing file gets added again, the current item should be set to it.
  * Previous button behaves more like a "Back" button: does not go to
    the item above the current item, but to the item played right before
    (think queues and random mode).
  * When searching in the playlist and returning enter, the Next button
    gets disabled if there's only one item in the search result, but
    when earsing the search it does not get re-enabled again.

UI:
  * connect track change / playlist change with statusbar and caption

Statusbar:
  * Make the slider able to seek
  * Blink labels while paused?
  * <Ganneff> is it possible to get a "you have XXX songs in this
    playlist" info somewhere in the display? maybe with an added "this is
    5 hours of noise"

Options:
  * First radio button properly vertically aligned

Appearance:
  * Draw column separators in the playlist? (HOWTO: playlistitem.cpp:595)
    And, only in the Amarok classic theme, or always?

Last.fm:
  * GStreamer gets the length of some songs wrong, asigning a much
    longer duration (22:04 for my copy of Under My Thumb). The internal
    timer of LastfmSubmitter will never finishes, because the song
    finishes first. It'd be nice to connect the submitter to end_of_stream
    from Engine, and call self.submit() iff the timer is active at the time.

Other:
  * Save window position?, maybe use a meaningful size the first time
  * If the KDE session ends with Minirok minimized in the systray, then
    Minirok should restore itself only to the systray in the next session.
  * It'd be nice to have module and line numbers in logging output, but
    it doesn't seem to work.
