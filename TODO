(This list is obviosly not complete, just here to not forget of these.)

Tree View:
  * Display file count when dragging?
  * Use a regex as well to control the appearance of file names?

Playlist:
  * Undo/redo?
  * Tabs??
  * Previous button behaves more like a "Back" button: does not go to
    the item above the current item, but to the item played right before
    (think queues and random mode).
  * After clearing a search, the playlist scrolls to the top, which may
    not show the current item as visible.
  * Limiting the search, and removing all visible items, removes all
    non-visible items in between.
  * Er, can't drag & drop tracks into the *first position* of the
    playlist.

UI:
  * connect track change / playlist change with statusbar and caption

Statusbar:
  * Make the slider able to seek
  * <Ganneff> is it possible to get a "you have XXX songs in this
    playlist" info somewhere in the display? maybe with an added "this is
    5 hours of noise"

Options:
  * First radio button properly vertically aligned

Appearance:
  * Draw column separators in the playlist? (HOWTO: playlistitem.cpp:595)
    And, only in the Amarok classic theme, or always?

Other:
  * Save window position?, maybe use a meaningful size the first time
  * It'd be nice to have module and line numbers in logging output, but
    it doesn't seem to work.
  * Read directory contents in a separate thread, as we do with tags.
    But probably when ported to Qt4, see:
      http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2008-January/018103.html
  * Use __slots__ for TreeViewItems?
