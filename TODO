(This list is obviosly not complete, just here to not forget of these.)

Tree View:
  * Button/context menu to refresh the tree view? (Or be able to monitor
    file tree with inotify instead)
  * Remove artifacts in the pointer when dragging (display file count?)
  * Use a regex as well to control the appearance of file names?

Playlist:
  * Undo/redo?
  * Tabs??
  * If while playing the list gets cleared, and then the currently
    playing file gets added again, the current item should be set to it.
  * Previous button behaves more like a "Back" button: does not go to
    the item above the current item, but to the item played right before
    (think queues and random mode).

UI:
  * connect track change / playlist change with statusbar and caption

Statusbar:
  * Make the slider able to seek
  * Blink labels while paused?
  * <Ganneff> is it possible to get a "you have XXX songs in this
    playlist" info somewhere in the display? maybe with an added "this is
    5 hours of noise"

Systray:
  * Tooltip with track information (title, artist, maybe album, maybe
    cover image, if it exists).

Options:
  * First radio button properly vertically aligned

Appearance:
  * Draw column separators in the playlist? (HOWTO: playlistitem.cpp:595)
    And, only in the Amarok classic theme, or always?

Last.fm:
  * GStreamer gets the length of some songs wrong, asigning a much
    longer duration (22:04 for my copy of Under My Thumb). The internal
    timer of LastfmSubmitter will never finishes, because the song
    finishes first. It'd be nice to connect the submitter to end_of_stream
    from Engine, and call self.submit() iff the timer is active at the time.

Other:
  * Save window position?, maybe use a meaningful size the first time
  * It'd be nice to have module and line numbers in logging output, but
    it doesn't seem to work.
