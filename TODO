(This list is obviosly not complete, just here to not forget of these.)

Tree View:
  * Button/context menu to refresh the tree view? (Or be able to monitor
    file tree with inotify instead)
  * Double click/return to append to the playlist?
  * Remove artifacts in the pointer when dragging (display file count?)
  * Use a regex as well to control the appearance of file names?

Playlist:
  * Enqueue items
  * Stop after this/current track
  * Undo/redo?
  * Tabs??
  * If while playing the list gets cleared, and then the currently
    playing file gets added again, the current item should be set to it.
  * Scroll automatically so that the current track is always visible
    (QListView.ensureItemVisible()).

UI:
  * Seek bar with elapsed --[]-- remaining.
  * connect track change / playlist change with statusbar and caption
  * Make stop button pop a menu between "now", "after current track",
    and "after queue".

Options:
  * First radio button properly vertically aligned
  * Save window size and position, and use a meaningful size the first time

Appearance:
  * Draw column separators in the playlist? (HOWTO: playlistitem.cpp:595)
    And, only in the Amarok classic theme, or always?

Other:
  * Configured shortcut keys seems not to get used
  * It'd be nice to have module and line numbers in logging output, but
    it doesn't seem to work.
