Files in these directory contain example code that expose bugs in the
PyKDE bindings. For each example, a working C++ example is provided,
plus a direct translation to Python which does not work.

  * combo.cc, combo.py:
    Completion in KURLComboBox does not work. To reproduce, type a path
    in the provided combo box.

  * gaccel.cc, gaccel.py:
    Using global shortcuts crashes the Python application. To reproduce,
    press Ctrl+Alt+U.

  * saveProperties.cc, saveProperties.py:
    Re-implementing KMainWindow::saveProperties() crashes the application
    at logout. To reproduce, launch saveProperties.py in the background,
    and log out (using xsm also works).

  * xml_toolbar.cc, xml_toolbar.py, xml_toolbar.rc:
    Subclassing KXMLGUIClient doesn't seem to work. See also kxmlguiclient.py.
