Files in these directory contain example code that expose bugs in the
PyKDE4 bindings. For each example, a working C++ example is provided,
plus a direct translation to Python which does not work.

I send these examples to the PyQt mailing lists, CCing Simond Edwards.

All files in this directory are placed in the public domain.
