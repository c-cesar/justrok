      Minirok is a small music player written in Python for the K Desktop
      Environment. As its name hints, it's modelled after Amarok, but with a
      reduced set of features. In particular, it is designed to cover all the
      needs and wishes of the author, leaving everything else out. The look
      and feel is almost identical to Amarok's, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main interface is a <b>tree view of the filesystem</b>, with a playlist
      that can only be populated via drag and drop. There is no collection
      built from tags, so it's targeted at people whose collection is
      structured in a tree already at the filesystem level. Searches can be
      performed both in the tree view and the playlist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        DCOP interface for controlling the player and retrieving the
        currently played track, among other things
      </li>

      <li>
        alter the playing order in the playlist by queueing tracks;
        stop after a certain track; repeat track or playlist; random mode;
	undo and redo
      </li>

      <li>
        reading of tags when adding to the playlist can be disabled by
        specifying a regular expression to extract them from the filename
      </li>

      <li>
        submission of played songs to Last.fm (with lastfmsubmitd)
      </li>

      <li>
        support for the classic Amarok "funky-monkey" theme
      </li>

      <li>
        global keybindings (see README.Usage for details)
      </li>
    </ul>
