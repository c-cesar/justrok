      Minirok is a small music player written in Python for the K Desktop
      Environment. As its name hints, it's modelled after Amarok, but with a
      reduced set of features. In particular, it is designed to cover all the
      needs and wishes of the author, leaving everything else out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main interface is a <b>tree view of the filesystem</b>, with a playlist
      that can only be populated via drag and drop. There is no collection
      built from tags, so it's targetted at people whose collection is
      structured in a tree already at the filesystem level. Searches can be
      performed both in the tree view and the playlist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other features include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          DCOP interface for controlling the player and retrieving the
          currently played track

        <li>
          alter the playing order in the playlist by queueing tracks;
          stop after a certain track; undo and redo

        <li>
          reading of tags when adding to the playlist can be disabled by
          specifying a regex to extract them from the filename

        <li>
          submission of played songs to Last.fm (with lastfmsubmitd)

        <li>
          support for the classic Amarok "funky-monkey" theme

        <li>
          global keybindings (see README.Usage for details)
      </ul>
      See the <a href="minirok.dev/README">README file</a> for more
